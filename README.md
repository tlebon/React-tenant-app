Hello my name is Timothy LeBon, this is my simple rental form for Home.ht using react. 

It was built with create-react-app. 

To use simply copy the repository to your computer and then run 
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. if necessary direct your browser to localhost:3000


if you dont have npm installed for some reason please look here:

Cheers and thanks for looking!
